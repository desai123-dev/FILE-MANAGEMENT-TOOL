Project Title: C++ File Management Tool
Internship Program: CODTECH – Task 1

Project Description:

This project, titled "C++ File Management Tool", was developed as part of Task-1 for the CODTECH Internship Program. The primary goal of this task is to demonstrate the use of file handling operations in C++, a fundamental concept that plays a vital role in building real-world software that interacts with data stored on disk.

The File Management Tool is a console-based application that allows the user to perform basic yet essential operations on files. These include:

Writing to a file: The tool allows the user to input text which is then written to a file. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
Reading from a file: The user can view the contents of an existing file, displaying it line-by-line on the console.
Appending to a file: Instead of overwriting, the user can choose to add new data to the end of the file without losing previous content.
These functionalities are implemented using C++'s standard file stream classes — ofstream, ifstream, and fstream. The logic of the program includes user interaction through a simple text-based menu that guides the user to select the desired operation. Each operation is clearly labeled and handled with proper validation to ensure file integrity and error management.

Technical Implementation:

Header Files Used: The project primarily uses #include <iostream>, #include <fstream>, and #include <string>. These enable input/output streams, file stream operations, and string manipulations, respectively.
File Handling Classes:
ofstream: For writing data to files.
ifstream: For reading data from files.
fstream: For both reading and writing operations.
Control Flow: A loop allows users to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit. Input validation is included to handle unexpected inputs or non-existent files gracefully.
Objectives and Learning Outcomes:

This project was designed not only to fulfill the internship requirement but also to strengthen understanding of:

How files are opened, written to, read from, and closed in C++
The difference between various file stream classes and their appropriate use cases
Managing input/output operations with error handling
Using loops, conditionals, and functions to modularize and organize code
Working on this project has provided valuable insight into how file handling can be applied to manage persistent data in real applications, such as data storage, configuration files, logs, and more.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the C++ File Management Tool is a functional and educational project that demonstrates the practical use of file handling in C++. It serves as a strong foundation for more complex applications involving data processing and storage. As a Task-1 submission for the CODTECH Internship, it successfully fulfills the criteria of demonstrating proficiency in basic file operations, structured programming, and user interface design through console inputs.
